## 5. Run the local server

We're ready to actually start work on our app! Let's run our app locally using a Firebase CLI command:

```
firebase serve
```

The following response should display in your terminal:

```
âœ”  hosting: Local server: http://localhost:5000
```

We're using the [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) emulator to serve our app locally. The web app should now be available from [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). Open it. You should see your copy of FriendlyEats which has been connected to your Firebase project.

firebase serve

The app has automatically connected to your project and silently signed you in as an anonymous user.
