### What you'll learn

- Read and write data to Cloud Firestore from a web app
- Listen to changes in Cloud Firestore data in realtime
- Use Firebase Authentication and security rules to secure Cloud Firestore data
- Write complex Cloud Firestore queries

### What you'll need

Before starting this codelab, make sure that you've installed:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which typically comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- The IDE/text editor of your choice such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

> **Note:** Although Node.js is a requirement for running and testing our app, the final application will not be dependent on Node.js.
