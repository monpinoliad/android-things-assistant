[Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html)  makes developing connected embedded devices easy by providing the same Android development tools, best-in-class Android framework, and Google APIs that make developers successful on mobile. Android Things extends the core Android framework with additional APIs provided by the Things Support Library. These APIs allow apps to integrate with new types of hardware not found on mobile devices.

The [Google Assistant SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/) lets you add voice control, natural language understanding, and Google's smarts to your devices. Your device captures an utterance (a spoken audio request, such as "What's on my calendar?"), sends it to the Google Assistant, and receives a spoken audio response in addition to the raw text of the utterance.


### **What you will build**

In this codelab, you're going to use Android Things and the Google Assistant SDK to build your own custom Google Assistant device.

It will use a button to trigger a microphone and play back the Assistant answer on an external speaker.
