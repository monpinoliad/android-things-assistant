## 3. Get things set up

To run the sample application, the following dependencies are required:

- [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/)
- [Maven3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

All these dependencies have been pre-installed for you on [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/) which we will use for this codelab.

If you don't have a Cloud Shell window open already, open one by clicking Cloud Shell symbol <img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spanner-first-steps-java/img/cc105fc96853ad17.png" width="25" height="25"> in the upper right corner. All following command line instructions are executed in the Cloud Shell session.

You can open additional Cloud Shell sessions by clicking on "+" in the Cloud Shell sessions tab bar .
