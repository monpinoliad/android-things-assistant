## 4. Setup a Cloud Spanner Instance

In this step we setup our Cloud Spanner Instance for this codelab. Search for the Spanner entry <img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spanner-first-steps-java/img/8166538a492c0ab1.png" width="100"> in the left top Hamburger Menu <img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spanner-first-steps-java/img/375d46e832085b56.png" width="25"> or search for Spanner by pressing "/" and type "Spanner"

Next, click on <img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spanner-first-steps-java/img/3dd34234dc2ac37e.png" width="100"> and fill out the form by choosing a name for your instance, a configuration (select a regional instance), and set the number of nodes, for this codelab we will only need 1 node. For production instances and to qualify for the Cloud Spanner SLA you will need to run 3 or more nodes in your Cloud Spanner instance.

Last, but not least, click on "Create" and within seconds you have a Cloud Spanner instance at your disposal.

In the next step we are going to create a database and schema in our new instance.
