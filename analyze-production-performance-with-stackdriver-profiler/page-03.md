Alternatively you can use the Cloud Console search bar to navigate to the Profiler UI: just type "Stackdriver Profiler" and select the found item. Either way, you should see the Profiler UI with the "No data to display" message like below. The project is new, so it doesn't have any profiling data collected yet.

It's now time to get something profiled!
